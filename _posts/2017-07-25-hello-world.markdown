I've found that it's easy to pass through months at a time, and not be able
to answer the question "What have you accomplished recently?"

In an attempt to put things I've learned or struggled with into coherent
thoughts with direct takeaways, I am going to document them on this blog.

This will be mostly for my own benefit, but I am making this public to keep
myself accountable. So, to start with a huge cliche:

{% highlight ruby %}
puts 'Hello, world!'
#=> 'Hello, world!'
{% endhighlight %}
